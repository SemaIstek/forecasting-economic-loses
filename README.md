# forecasting-economic-loses
A predictive model project to estimate economic losses from natural disasters globally over the next 25 years using machine learning and statistical modeling.

# Forecast 2050: Economic Impact of Natural Disasters

## Project Overview
This project, "Forecast 2050", aims to forecast the economic impact of natural disasters globally over the next 25 years. Utilizing a combination of machine learning techniques and statistical models, we aim to provide insights that can help policymakers and businesses prepare and mitigate the financial risks associated with these events.

## Features
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Using historical data to predict future economic impacts.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of data and forecasts to aid in interpretation and decision-making.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Tools that allow users to visualize potential economic outcomes under different scenarios.

## Data Sources
This project uses multiple data sources including:
- Historical economic data from the World Bank.
- Natural disaster data sets from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).
- Climate change projections from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).
